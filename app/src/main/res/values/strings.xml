2) While x is not leaf, do following
..a) Find the child of x that is going to be traversed next. Let the child be y.
..b) If y is not full, change x to point to y.
..c) If y is full, split it and change x to point to one of the two parts of y.
        If k is smaller than mid key in y, then set x as first part of y. Else second part of
        y. When we split y, we move a key from y to its parent x.
3) The loop in step 2 stops when x is leaf. x must have space for 1 extra key as we have been splitting
        all nodes in advance. So simply insert k to x.
